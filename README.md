# UNITY_3D_INDIVIDUAL_BRICK_BLOCK_DESTRUCTION
Quick instructions on how to accomplish brick/brick destruction


Just decided to write up instructions for others as well on the game's insta page:

I will share the entire project with you if desired, although it is quite hefty at 10 gigabytes compressed (about 20 uncompressed)

Now getting around 40fps at peak mostly about 25fps, [although I was getting that before](https://youtu.be/n76D1T679uU) the addition of this destructive instance (with car deformation etc), so definitely needs optimization (game has 6800+ buildings based on real world GIS location data/Jamaica, although the only 1 destructive instance seen in video, along with vegetation biome, dynamic grass, aura lighting etc)!

For destruction, *with a little trick of mine on top*, I used [DinoFracture plugin](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/dinofracture-a-dynamic-fracture-library-26599).
